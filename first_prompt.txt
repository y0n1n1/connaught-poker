 we will create a gh repo and start a web app typescript shadcn ui tailwind rest api railway backend deploy vercel frontend deploy (not sure which db to     
  use yet) project. the project will be a simple web app to track me and my friends poker games in our dorm. we will have around 20 active users max,         
  and keep very little data (just small stuff like tracking who bought in to what games, who won, etc). our goal is to have fun features like a               
  leaderboard, a user's cumulative winnings, etc. would also be cool to have a feature to help our game host (filipo) to track who sent him buyins and        
  who still has to send, etc. the only inputs we will ever have are from each player/user. we will publicly display buyin info since filipo isn't always      
  the host. since this is pretty non-serious information we don't mind if the leaderboard is publicly visible, etc, but only each player can check their      
  account info privately, and choose what to display on their public profiles (e.g. i might want to display my cumulative winnings publicly but another       
  player might not). we also need simple history/logging for each player and for games as a whole. i expect the db to only need: games table, users           
  table. let me know if any of my ideas here are faulty and we should change. for now don't implement anything yet, we will just plan using markdown          
  files. once we start implementing, I want to work from the back up: db, then backend server, then frontend. I want to use next, node, prisma for db. 


  ❯ for auth lets do simple username password. lets also have a quick mechanism for forget passwords where I verify login (like when a friend forgets           
  password i'll just ask them what new password they want and set it myself, would be nice if I could set it myself from my account on the frontend).         
  since we have the same 20 or so people playing always, the game host should have an easy list style add method, where they pick out people's names from     
  a list. we could also have a simple click link to join game system, that the host can share. results for a game can be entered by either the host for       
  any player or by a player for their own info (a player can enter whether they bought in, etc, but not whether someone else bought in, but a host can        
  enter for anyone). privacy settings all fields should be toggleable. I like your docs approach, keep going.
